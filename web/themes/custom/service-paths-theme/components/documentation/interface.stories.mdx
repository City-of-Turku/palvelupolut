# Storybook's Interface
## Sidebar

The sidebar is the most important navigation element in Storybook. It contains a menu
of the documentation pages as well as all components. The components are grouped by
[atomic design principles]().

Some menu items are nested. This is indicated by a small triangle in front of the menu
item. Clicking on these menu items will expand the item and reveal the nested links.

## Search

At the top of the sidebar is a search box that allows you to search components by name.

## View options & shortcuts

Clicking on the 3 horizontal dots button will reveal an overlay menu with navigation options and options for
adjusting the current view. E.g., hiding the sidebar, toolbar or addons panel.

## Addon panel

The addon panel sits at the bottom of Storybook. Make sure that it's enabled in
[view options & shortcuts](#view-options--shortcuts). The panel contains tabs for automated accessibility
checks and viewing the HTML source among others.
