# Component structure

## Atomic Design principles

Atomic design principles have been implemented and are used to structure the components.
The main idea behind atomic design is that everything should be split up into the smallest possible reusable components
and then built up again. The smallest reusable pieces of code are the basic building blocks in atomic design. Since they
are not split into any smaller components they are usually called atoms. These include things like
[headings](?path=/story/atoms-text--heading), [links](?path=/story/atoms-links--link),
[buttons](?path=/story/atoms-button--button) and other small components.

Putting several small components together we can create larger things called molecules. For instance the
[Hero component](?path=/story/molecules-hero--hero) is a molecule that consists of a heading, long text and image atoms.
Adding molecules together we get organisms and so on. You can see this structure being reflected in the
[sidebar menu](?path=/story/documentation-interface--page#sidebar).

## Benefits of using Atomic design

Using atomic design comes with several benefits:

- Reuse: components are being reused instead of creating new components for every variation.
- Coherence: reusing the same components inevitably leads to having less variations of very similar components.
- Efficieny: new components can be created by forming new groups of smaller components. Atomic design can also help to
  implement changes faster since changes are propagated across all the components that use the changed component.
  A good structure is important however  since the opposite can also be true.
