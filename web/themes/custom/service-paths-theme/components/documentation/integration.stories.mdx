# Integration of the components

_Note: This documentation page mainly focuses on developers._

There are two parts when it comes to integrating components:
1. **[Making a component visible in Storybook](#making-components-visible-in-storybook)**
2. **[Integrating components with Drupal](#integrating-components-with-drupal)**

> By default, when you create a new component neither Storybook nor Drupal is aware of it's existence.

By adding a story to **Storybook** the component is made visible in Storybook.

Integrating a component into **Drupal** means using it in some Drupal template. In other words, making Drupal render the
component.

## The structure of a component

Components are located in the `./components` directory inside the Drupal theme. The components are written in
[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) and are intended to be used in Drupal, but they can be run in any framework that
supports Twig.

A component usually consists of the following:

- A **Twig template**
- An **SCSS stylesheet**
- **JavaScript** logic
- Storybook integration **metadata**

Everything that makes up a component should be placed inside it's own directory named after the component.

The component template contains the markup of the component with placeholders for data passed into it. A component can
also include other components. For example, in Atomic Design a molecule component is made out of several atom components.

Let's look at the _CTA_ component: it contains a heading, some text, an icon and a link. All of these are being reused
and the component itself only adds some wrappers around the included components. The heading that is based on the
_Heading_ component, the lead text is based on the _Long text_ component and so on.

```twig
<div {{ bem(cta__base_class, cta__modifiers, cta__blockname) }} >
  {% include "@atoms/text/heading/heading.twig" with {
    heading__level: 3,
    heading: cta__title,
  } %}

  {% include "@atoms/text/text-long/text-long.twig" with {
    text_long__content:  cta__lead_text,
  } %}

  <div {{ bem("icon-wrapper", [], cta__base_class) }}>
    {% include "@atoms/images/fontawesome-icon/fontawesome-icon.twig" with {
      fontawesome_icon__name: cta__icon,
    } %}
  </div>

  {% include "@atoms/links/link/link.twig" with {
    link__url: cta__link,
    link__icon_before: "arrow-right",
  } %}
</div>
```

## Making components visible in Storybook

As mentioned, by default Storybook is not aware that a component exists. We need to add some Storybook specific metadata
that describes the component to make it visible in Storybook.

> Storybook metadata should always be placed in the `./stories` directory inside the component directory

### Adding stories

Each entry in Storybook is called **a story**. Since Storybook is a React based tool we use React to create a new story.
Stories are put inside a file named `*.stories.js` where `*` is replaced with the name of your component. E.g.,
`hero.stories.js` located in `./components/molecules/hero/stories`.

### Parts of a story file

The main parts when adding a story file are:

 - **Importing** the component template and data that will be passed to it.
 - **The default export**. It should be an object that has at least a `title` property with a string value. This will
   determine the name of the component as well as the location of it inside the Storybook sidebar.
 - **Named exports** will create sub-sections under the component name in the sidebar. These should be functions that
   return a React component that will render the component markup.

### Rendering a story

A simple story file could look like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import heroTemplate from '../hero.twig';
import heroData from './hero.yml';

/**
 * Storybook Definition.
 */
export default { title: 'Molecules/Hero' };

export const Hero = () => {
  const markup = heroTemplate(heroData);
  return (
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: markup }} />
  );
};

```

> The actual Hero story looks a bit different than this simplified example. Mainly we add some convenience wrappers
> around our components.

That is enough to make a component visible in Storybook. We import our component's Twig template as well as some example
data stored in a YAML file that we pass to the component. The `Hero` export will render a div and set it's HTML contents
to be the rendered result of the Twig template with the example data passed into it.

### Passing data to stories

Notice in the example above that we import a YAML file. Example data that we want to pass to our components is stored
in YAML files.

Data for the Hero stored inside `hero.yml` could look like this:

```yml
hero__title: 'Päivähoito Turussa'
hero__lead_text:
  'Varhaiskasvatuksen palvelut on tarkoitettu kaikille alle kouluikäisille lapsille Turussa.
  Tältä sivulta löydät kaiken tarvitsemasi tiedon vaihtoehdoista ja hakuprosessista.  Löydetään
  yhdessä lapsellesi sopivin vaihtoehto!'
hero__image:
  image_src: '/hero.jpg'
hero__modifiers:
  - 'dark'
```


By importing different data sets and passing them to the component we can showcase different use cases in Storybook. A
more complex example can look like this:

```jsx
// ... other imports

import headerTemplate from '../header.twig';

import breadcrumbData from '../../../02-molecules/navigation/breadcrumbs/stories/breadcrumbs.yml';
import languageMenuData from '../../../02-molecules/navigation/language-switcher/stories/language-switcher.yml';

/**
 * Storybook Definition.
 */
export default { title: 'Organisms/Header' };

export const header = () => (
  <div
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: headerTemplate({
        ...languageMenuData,
        ...breadcrumbData,
      }),
    }}
  />
);
```

### Story templates

Sometimes it's necessary to wrap a component inside another component when displaying the component story. For instance,
when displaying a grid layout it might make sense to display it inside the page layout. This can be
achieved by adding a Twig template whose only purpose is to create the necessary markup for the story.

Inside that template both the page layout and the grid would be imported and the grid would then be rendered inside
the page layout by using Twig blocks or passing it as a variable to the page layout.

```twig
{% embed "page-layout.twig" %}
  {% block page_content %}
    {% include "grid.twig" %}
  {% endblock %}
{% endembed %}
```

_Note: Twig templates that are used only in Storybook should always be placed inside the `./stories` directory._

### Going further

Inspect some existing story definition files or consult the official
[Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) to learn more about creating
stories.


## Integrating components with Drupal

Integrating a component with Drupal requires two steps:

  1. [Connecting a Drupal template with the component](#connecting-a-drupal-template-with-the-component)
  2. [Mapping Twig variables](#mapping-twig-variables)

The components live inside the `./components` directory inside the Drupal theme. Integrating a component
with Drupal means wiring it up with a Drupal template from the `./templates` directory. So, whenever Drupal renders a
Drupal template it renders the component.

![The connection between Drupal and Storybook](/documentation/drupal.jpg)

### Differences with regular Drupal Twig templates

The components behave like regular Drupal Twig templates with a few differences:

  - Since the components are located outside of the `./templates` directory Drupal is not aware of them and ignores them
    by default.
  - The components do not contain Drupal specific markup. They are built from the perspective of a site builder.
    Components are written from the ground up to only contain the necessary markup instead of taking the default markup
    and adjusting that. This makes them better fit their intended purpose but also means that variables need to be mapped.

### Connecting a Drupal template with the component

Let's say we have a Hero component that needs to be connected with Drupal. To do this we need to find out which Drupal
template should be rendering our component and include our component inside that template. This could be a paragraph and
so we would include our `/components/hero/hero.twig` inside `./templates/paragraph--hero.html.twig`

![Connecting a Storybook component with Drupal](/documentation/templates.jpg)

Whenever a paragraph of type hero is being rendered Drupal will now display our component. The last remaining step is
to pass data from Drupal to the component.

> **NB:** no markup should be added to Drupal templates inside `./templates`. All markup should come from the components.

> Twig namespaces of either `@atoms`, `@molecules`, `@organisms` or `@template` can be used to reference the component.

For instance, connecting the CTA component to a Drupal template could look like this:

```twig
{% include "@molecules/cta/cta.twig" with {
  "cta__title": content.field_cta_title,
  "cta__lead_text": content.field_cta_text,
} %}
```

The integration of a component to another framework would be similar: import the template and pass the necessary data.

#### Twig `include` vs `embed` vs `extends`

The key differences between `include` vs `embed` vs `extends` statements:

  - `include` and `embed` allow additional markup inside the host template.
  - `embed` and `extends` allow overriding [Twig blocks](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/functions/block.html).

The most restrictive option is `extends` but it is also the recommended option in most cases. `extends` allows
overriding Twig blocks and overriding variables by setting them to a different value in the host template.

### Mapping Twig variables

The components expect data to be passed in a certain way. Making sure that data from Drupal matches the expected format
of the component is called mapping. Mapping is required almost in all cases.

The simplest use case is when data only needs to be assigned to the correct variable. Taking another look at the CTA
example:

```twig
{% include "@molecules/cta/cta.twig" with {
  "cta__title": content.field_cta_title,
  "cta__lead_text": content.field_cta_text|field_value,
} %}
```

Here we pass the CTA title field to the `cta__title` variable and the value of the Lead text field to `cta__lead_text`.
Notice that we apply a Twig filter in the case of the lead text.

#### Passing a primitive value vs passing a field render array

Passing `content.field_cta_text|field_value` instead of `content.field_cta_text` is quite different.

- **Passing a primitive value**. In the first case the `field_value` Twig filter is applied. Simplifying things a bit, it
  returns only the value of the field. In case of long text field this would be a string value. The filter is added by
  the [Twig Field Value](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_field_value) contributed module.
- **Passing a render array**. When we pass `content.field_cta_text` to a component and the component prints that value
  it will start the Drupal rendering process. This means preprocess functions will run and the Drupal templates that
  are associated with the render array will be printed as well.

#### Some hints

**Getting the URL of a link field**

The [Twig Field Value](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_field_value) Drupal module is used to get the value of
the field.
```twig
{% set card__url = content.field_link|field_value|first["#url"] %}
```

**Checking if a field has a value**

Oftentimes it's not enough to just check if a field's value has a truthy value.
```twig
{% set has_sidebar = content.field_paragraphs_sidebar|render|trim is not empty %}
```
