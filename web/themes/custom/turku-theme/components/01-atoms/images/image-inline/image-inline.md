### Image inline

This component is a pure CSS component. Use it like this:

```
  background-image: data-url($image-inline--svg-collapse-open, svg);
```

When adding a new variable to `image-inline.scss` make sure to
update the Storybook story as well by editing `wunder_theme/storybook/storybook.scss`.
